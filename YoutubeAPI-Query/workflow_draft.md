# Framing (describe main idea)
(Paris / London)
- Paris transportation before, during and after covid
- Paris bicycle improvements - can we see a signal before and after how people traverse through these locations?


# Alteration from GISRUK2022 presentation
Since street-name detection (OCR) is computationally expensive, we propose
to leverage video timestamps containing potential toponym location information
to geolocate video segments.
The YoutubeAPI allows for the search of videos via a search query
and gives access to the metadata of these video, including the user-generated description with
potential timestamps.
